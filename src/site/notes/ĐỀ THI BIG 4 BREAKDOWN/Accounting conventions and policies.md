# Accounting Conventions and Policies

## Summary
Conventions are accepted practices (historical cost, matching, etc.). Policies are specific choices made by an entity in applying standards.

## Key Points
- Conventions: historical cost, matching, realisation, etc.
- Policies: entity-specific choices for recognition, measurement, and presentation.
- Must be disclosed and applied consistently.
