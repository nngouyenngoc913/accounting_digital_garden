# Allowances for Doubtful Debts

## Overview

An allowance for doubtful debts is a provision made to cover estimated losses from receivables that may not be collected. It ensures that the carrying amount of receivables reflects their net realizable value.

---

## Purpose

- To prudently estimate and recognize potential losses on receivables.
- To avoid overstating assets and profits.
- To comply with the matching principle by recognizing expected losses in the correct period.

---

## Calculation and Accounting Treatment

- The allowance is calculated based on historical data, aging of receivables, or specific customer circumstances.
- The allowance is a **contra asset account** that reduces the gross receivables balance.
- Movements in the allowance are recorded as an expense or income in the statement of profit or loss.

**Journal entries:**

- To increase allowance:  
  Dr Irrecoverable Debts Expense  
  Cr Allowance for Doubtful Debts

- To decrease allowance:  
  Dr Allowance for Doubtful Debts  
  Cr Irrecoverable Debts Expense

---

## Example

At the start of the year, the allowance for doubtful debts is £6,800. During the year, debts of £15,000 are written off as irrecoverable. At year-end, the business estimates that an allowance of £3,000 is required.

**Accounting for write-offs:**  
Dr Irrecoverable Debts Expense £15,000  
Cr Trade Receivables £15,000

**Adjusting allowance:**  
Opening allowance: £6,800  
Less write-offs: £15,000 (already expensed)  
Required allowance: £3,000  
Movement = Required allowance - (Opening allowance - Write-offs) = £3,000 - (£6,800 - £15,000) = £11,200 increase

Journal to adjust allowance:  
Dr Irrecoverable Debts Expense £11,200  
Cr Allowance for Doubtful Debts £11,200

# Impact on Financial Statements

## Overview

Accounting adjustments such as write-offs, allowances, accruals, prepayments, and depreciation affect the financial statements by altering reported profits and asset/liability values. Understanding these impacts is essential for accurate financial reporting.

---

## Key Impacts

### 1. Irrecoverable Debts and Allowances

- Writing off irrecoverable debts reduces trade receivables (asset) and increases expenses, lowering profit.
- Creating or adjusting allowances for doubtful debts reduces net receivables and affects profit through expense recognition.

### 2. Accruals and Prepayments

- Accruals increase expenses and liabilities, reducing profit.
- Prepayments decrease expenses and increase assets, increasing profit.

### 3. Depreciation and Provisions

- Depreciation expense reduces profit and the carrying amount of non-current assets.
- Provisions increase liabilities and expenses, reducing profit.

### 4. Inventory Valuation

- Changes in inventory valuation affect cost of sales and thus profit.
- Lower of cost and net realisable value rule may require write-downs, reducing profit.

### 5. Errors and Corrections

- Errors can distort profit and asset/liability balances.
- Corrections via suspense accounts and journal entries restore accurate financial reporting.

---
## Example

A company has trade receivables of £100,000 with an allowance for doubtful debts of £5,000. During the year, £3,000 of debts are written off, and the allowance is increased by £2,000.

**Effect on financial statements:**

- Trade receivables net value decreases by £3,000 (write-off) plus £2,000 (allowance increase) = £5,000.
- Expenses increase by £5,000, reducing profit.
- Assets decrease by £5,000 due to lower net receivables.
